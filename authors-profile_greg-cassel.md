#### About Me
	
I'm lifelong artist and philosopher.  I've become a *p2p organizing systems engineer and facilitator* through challenging learning experiences in underachieving activist groups.  I focus on developing and using open source, interoperable *p2p organizing frameworks and protocols*.  I'm deeply concerned with digital networking tools, but I prioritize *culture* and *social standards* which integrate consent-based organizing, compassionate communications and transformative justice.

I've participated in diverse communities and team projects including Library of the Commons, Value Flows, Open App Ecosystem, Collaborative Technology Alliance, the Enspiral Network, Classroom Graffiti Productions, and lots of volunteer social media administration positions.

I love to garden and hike.  Someday, when p2p organizing resources are much better developed and appreciated, I'd love to focus on developing "Penumbral": a massively multiparticipant world-building, co-authorship and interactive adventure network.
	
### Current Main Works: P2P Organizing Vocabulary and Frameworks

Each of the following p2p organizing frameworks could enable or facilitate the development of p2p organizing structures and activities, including resources and systems of any type at all levels of complexity.

#### [Modular Organizing Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology) (MOT)
	
###### MOT is a generalized formal vocabulary for organizing and design work.  It fosters clarity and consistency in my personal and collaborative creative processes, including all of my p2p organizing models.
		
###### As of February 2019, MOT includes over 550 heavily cross-linked definitions. Some version of it could become practically usable as a formal language unto itself, if some basic grammar and semantic links were refined for that purpose.

#### [Inclusive Organizing Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_KwMbdghVVv1FODuy21QsXXXHsAKTLGc0YGT64oh0mg/edit?usp=sharing) (IOF)

###### IOF is a developmental framework which suggests a methodical process for inclusively and scalably developing a distributed collective.  IOF is a "framework of frameworks" which incorporates other frameworks below as components.

#### [P2P Modular Organizing Diagram](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1KZpc4_98IrJ0cjcFpkL5TcBug63fsTrT6i5eL2j5z80/edit?usp=sharing)  (MOD)
	
###### MOD is a visual directory for my other organizing frameworks. It's based on levels of conceptual organizing (*language, recipe, plan and governance*) which integrate p2p organizing frameworks with models representing *community ecosystems* and *distributed computing systems*.	

#### [Consent-Based Governance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c_xWEIay-2jyJ3Rqb6OgTxoZBJfjNW4d6w6ukXyeJk4/edit?usp=sharing) (CBG)
		
###### CBG is a framework of principles and practices for developing consent-based agreements and collectives/ organizations.  In consent-based governance, *all* tools and techniques which restrict the use of collective resources, or modify such restrictions, should be determined by the direct written consent of each of the collective’s active governing members.
		
###### CBG is a radical evolution of anarchism theory, meant to scale for a digitally networked world.  I think that anarchism is urgently important and *now feasible* at massively networked scales, via the modular networking which I suggest in Inclusive Governance Framework (see below) and other works.
		
#### [Resource Support Framework](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1frX5ay_adnhdmaSbqCr-Z63_f1o7xyZN4e8IdI2hcts/edit?usp=sharing) (RSF)

###### RSF is a generic system for collaboratively developing and supporting any type of resource.  RSF integrates subsidiary models for Personal Experience, Inclusive Dialogue, Inclusive Action (see Inclusive Action Framework below) and Social Support Systems.  RSF integrates compassionate conflict resolution and transformative justice principles.

#### [Inclusive Action Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E5V8LggadbbAaJw9tK_OT22VyciO4OE9ml1fiXYyfmk/edit?usp=sharing)  (IAF)
	
###### IAF suggests a standardized iterative process for inclusively designing and developing specific resources, including shared goals and media items such as written agreements.  IAF includes but transcends governance; it suggests ongoing co-creative dialogue between designers, collectives and communities.
		
###### IAF functions as a primary component of RSF. IAF also functions as a basic suggested protocol for inclusively developing proposals in CBG.
		
#### [Inclusive Meeting and Event Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bsobPV43r4rZ1GBkxmtwl1j7Zdn6qQhJZD0ta85Kw2I/edit?usp=sharing) (IMEF)
	
###### IMEF is a basic co-creative framework and recipe for hosting and facilitating inclusive discussion and design meetings and events with many p2p inputs.  
		
###### IMEF functions in IDF to coordinate relationships between live events and asynchronous, sequential processes.
	
#### [Inclusive Channel Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w9OkvXv7A89bySQT9e8iFWWp1TIkhUCUpTI6PwRpX20/edit?usp=sharing) (ICP)
		
###### ICP functions as a simple, practical constitution for media channels which aren’t attached to other governing bodies.  It can also serve as the core organizing kernel for complex collectives and networks. (See also IGF below.)
	
#### [Inclusive Governance Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cU0557pbNOAI2eco2Ura3HXdxC2v-SJBWMHYaGMHMtA/edit?usp=sharing) (IGF)

###### IGF builds on the organizing kernel of ICP with collective levels of organizing.  IGF suggests a general *Guest/Contributor/Member/Steward* participation model, meant to facilitate consent-based governance of complex collectives and of their media networks.

#### [Collective Media Network Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_HztFXAWXtgiHnpBj7DxszNawKs8N0BPvv8fDxlMcE0/edit?usp=sharing) (CMNF)

###### CMNF is a developmental framework which suggests basic media networking processes and resources for large ongoing collectives.  CMNF is intended both for active collectives, which might or might not have much official structure, and for new collectives which emerge through IGF or other organizing models.CMNF is an IGF component.  

###### IGF is ambitiously meant to enable consent-based collectives (see CBG) and networks to scale to any possible size and complexity.  
		
#### [Collective Media Markup Language](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H55a5TncjaXhyBi9Bf-Uwslce5_FRhOY3BUk5t1rbRg/edit?usp=sharing) (CMML), Structured Conversation and [Collective Resource Description Framework](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/collective-resource-description-framework.md) (CRDF)
	
###### These are major works for digital networking in general, although they're only indirectly relevant to my current focus on social standards.
		
###### *CMML* suggests protocols to attach metadata to media resources, and to develop more intelligent and effective p2p distributed databases. CMML currently includes Structured Conversation, which suggests standards for organizing and networking conversations for action. 
###### *CRDF* is a potential output of CMML, enabling specific media items to be as portable as possible for fully distributed computing and networking.

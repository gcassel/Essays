### Personal Intro
	
I'm an artist and philosopher who's gradually become a peer-to-peer systems designer and facilitator, through many painful learning experiences in volunteer-led projects.  "The final suggestion, the final statement, has to be not a deliberate statement but a helpless statement. It has to be what you can't avoid saying."  -- Jasper Johns
	
I develop modular organizing language and open source, interoperable protocols and collaborative frameworks.  I'm deeply concerned with digital networking tech, but I prioritize social standards which integrate consent-based organizing, compassionate communications and transformative justice.
	
### Current Main Works
	
##### Modular Organizing Terminology (MOT)
	
MOT is a general terminology for organizing and design.  It's essential for fostering clarity and consistency in my creative processes, including all of my p2p organizing models.
		
As of February 2019, MOT includes over 550 heavily cross-linked definitions. It could become practically usable as a formal language unto itself, if some general semantic-link terms are refined for that purpose.	

#### Consent-Based Governance (CBG)
		
CBG is a set of principles and practices for developing consent-based agreements and collectives.  In consent-based governance, all tools and techniques which restrict the use of collective resources, or modify such restrictions, should be determined by the direct written consent of each of the collective’s active member-agents.
		
CBG is a radical evolution of anarchism theory.   I think such theory is now feasible and urgently important for humanity, via the modular and networked organizing which I suggest in Inclusive Network Governance and other works.
		
#### P2P Modular Organizing Framework  (MOF)
	
MOF is the most comprehensive directory for my p2p works so far.  It's a visual directory based on levels of conceptual organizing (language, recipe, plan and governance) which integrate most of my p2p collaborative frameworks, as well as a models for community ecosystems, distributed computing and collective media markup language.
		
#### Resource Support Framework  (RSF)

RSF is a generic system for the development and support of shared resources.  RSF integrates subsidiary models for Personal Experience, Inclusive Dialogue, (((Inclusive Design Framework))) and Social Support Systems.  RSF integrates compassionate conflict resolution and transformative justice principles.

	#### Inclusive Design Framework  (IDF)
	
IDF suggests a standardized cyclical process for inclusively developing any specific resources, including goals and media items.  IDF includes but transcends governance; it suggests ongoing co-creative dialogue between designers, collectives and communities.
		
IDF functions as a primary component of (RSF).   IDF also functions as a basic suggested protocol for inclusively developing proposals in CBG.
		
#### Inclusive Meeting and Event Framework (IMEF)
	
IMEF is a basic co-creative framework and recipe for hosting and facilitating inclusive discussion and design meetings and events with inputs from many co-creative peers.  
		
IMEF functions in (IDF) to coordinate relationships between events and asynchronous, sequential processes.
	
#### Inclusive Channel Policy (ICP)
		
ICP can serve as a practical constitution for media channels which aren’t attached to  other governing bodies.  It can also serve as the core organizing kernel for complex collectives and networks. (See also IGF below.)
	
#### Inclusive Governance Framework

ING builds on the organizing kernel of (ICP) with collective levels of organizing.  ING describes a general Guest/Contributor/Member/Steward participation model, meant to facilitate consent-based governance of complex collectives and of their media networks.

ING is ambitiously meant to enable consent-based collectives and networks to scale to any possible size and complexity.  It could become my most important work, although it depends heavily on others.
		
#### Collective Media Markup Language (CMML), Structured Conversation and Collective Resource Description Framework
	
These are major works of mine for digital networking in general, although only indirectly relevant to my focus on social standards.
		
CMML suggests protocols to attach metadata to media resources, to develop more intelligent and effective p2p distributed databases.   CMML currently includes Structured Conversation, which suggests standards for organizing and networking conversations for action. 
		
CRDF is a potential output of CMML, enabling specific media items to be as portable as possible.

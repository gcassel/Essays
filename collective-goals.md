*This document lists my current major [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md) goals, outside of existing team projects and my (primary) work to develop p2p collaborative frameworks.*

#### [Open Intermedia Commons](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RfXaOCg4VBZ2tcKu1tjBPIkabGruSLueH4T4g_8cWTs/edit?usp=sharing)

Open Intermedia Commons (OIC) will be an open standard, community, and a network of media resources which meet one or more of the open-licensing standards developed and openly shared by a new standards collective, Foundation for Open Intermedia (FOI).

#### Transformative Talks

A [Bridge the Divide](https://www.facebook.com/groups/bridgethedivide/) equivalent, but not on facebook, and including live empathy-building talks.  For bridging discussions on challenging social & political issues.

#### UUA Resources

I hope to help [Unitarian Universalism Association](https://www.uua.org/) (I'm a member) develop its online resources through increasingly [inclusive design process](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/inclusive-design-framework.md).

#### Basic Needs
 
Help develop collectives which co-generate commonly guaranteed basic needs, such as: housing, food, education, medical care, and/or income.   (Starting with small teams, and potentially scaling to globally guaranteed needs.)

#### Local Landscapes

A federation of collectives supporting a well-developed open standard for native plant landscaping, native wildlife habitat and conservation easements. Focused on protecting at-risk native plants and animals, especially pollinators.
	
### Interactive Multimedia Mapping and Storytelling 
		
#### Maine Waters  
* and/or Southeastern Waters
* develop a collaborative database and use metadata markup language to generate search, sort, filter and divergent multimedia storytelling sequences expressing the water cycle and contiguous biomes from mountaintops to open ocean.

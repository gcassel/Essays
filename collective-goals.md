*This document lists my current major [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md) goals, outside of existing team projects and my (primary) work to develop Inclusive Organizing Systems.*

#### [Open Intermedia Commons](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RfXaOCg4VBZ2tcKu1tjBPIkabGruSLueH4T4g_8cWTs/edit?usp=sharing)

Open Intermedia Commons (OIC) will be an open standard, community, and a network of media resources which meet one or more of the open-licensing standards developed and openly shared by a new standards collective, Foundation for Open Intermedia (FOI).

#### Transformative Talks

A [Bridge the Divide](https://www.facebook.com/groups/bridgethedivide/) equivalent, but not on facebook, and including live empathy-building talks.  For bridging discussions on challenging social & political issues.

#### Reclaiming Georgia

Reclaiming Georgia is a nascent potential regional *cell* (unit) of the Reclaiming Tradition of witchcraft.  (I'm a pagan, witch, druid and Buddhist.)

#### Basic Needs
 
Help develop collectives which co-generate commonly guaranteed basic needs, such as: housing, food, education, medical care, and/or income.   (Starting with small teams, and potentially scaling to globally guaranteed needs.)

#### Localized Landscapes

A federation of collectives supporting a well-developed open standard for permacultural and local plant landscaping, local wildlife habitat and conservation easements. Focused on protecting at-risk native plants and animals, especially pollinators.
